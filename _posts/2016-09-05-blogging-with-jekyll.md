**TL;DR** Use [Jekyll and Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/) for a clean and maintainable blog.

I have tried blogging using many blog platforms in the past like Blogger and Wordpress. But i have never been able to write more than one or two posts. Recently read about the concept of [Static](http://staticgen.com) website generators and I thought of giving it a try.  

This website is a combination of using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and Github Pages. Jekyll is a static site generator developed using Ruby programming language. Some of the advantages of using Jekyll and Github Pages instead of traditional blogging platform includes,

  * Static site
  * Easy Maintenance
  * Markdown Syntax
  * No Databases
  * Free Hosting
